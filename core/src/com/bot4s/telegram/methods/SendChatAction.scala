/**
 * Use this method when you need to tell the user that something is happening on the bot's side.
 * The status is set for 5 seconds or less (when a message arrives from your bot, Telegram clients clear its typing status).
 *
 * Example: The ImageBot needs some time to process a request and upload the image.
 * Instead of sending a text message along the lines of "Retrieving image, please wait...", the bot may use sendChatAction with action = upload_photo.
 * The user will see a "sending photo" status for the bot.
 * We only recommend using this method when a response from the bot will take a noticeable amount of time to arrive.
 *
 * @param chatId  Integer or String Unique identifier for the target chat or username of the target channel (in the format @channelusername)
 * @param action  String Type of action to broadcast.
 *                Choose one, depending on what the user is about to receive:
 *                typing for text messages, upload_photo for photos, record_video or upload_video for videos, record_audio or upload_audio for audio files, upload_document for general files, find_location for location data.

/**
 * Use this method to send answers to callback queries sent from inline keyboards.
 *
 * The answer will be displayed to the user as a notification at the top of the chat screen or as an alert.
 * On success, True is returned.
 *
 * Alternatively, the user can be redirected to the specified Game URL.
 * For this option to work, you must first create a game for your bot via BotFather and accept the terms.
 * Otherwise, you may use links like telegram.me/your_bot?start=XXXX that open your bot with a parameter.
 *
 * @param callbackQueryId String Unique identifier for the query to be answered
 * @param text            String Optional Text of the notification. If not specified, nothing will be shown to the user
 * @param showAlert       Boolean Optional If true, an alert will be shown by the client instead of a notification at the top of the chat screen. Defaults to false.
 * @param url             String Optional URL that will be opened by the user's client.
 *                        If you have created a Game and accepted the conditions via @Botfather, specify the URL that opens your game - note that this will only work if the query comes from a callback_game button.
 *                        Otherwise, you may use links like telegram.me/your_bot?start=XXXX that open your bot with a parameter.
 * @param cacheTime       Integer Optional The maximum amount of time in seconds that the result of the callback query may be cached client-side.
 *                        Telegram apps will support caching starting in version 3.14. Defaults to 0.

/**
 * This object represents an incoming callback query from a callback button in an inline keyboard.
 * If the button that originated the query was attached to a message sent by the bot, the field message will be presented.
 * If the button was attached to a message sent via the bot (in inline mode), the field inline_message_id will be presented.
 *
 * @param id               String Unique identifier for this query
 * @param from             User Sender
 * @param message          Message Optional Message with the callback button that originated the query.
 *                         Note that message content and message date will not be available if the message is too old
 * @param inlineMessageId  String Optional Identifier of the message sent via the bot in inline mode, that originated the query
 * @param chatInstance     String Identifier, uniquely corresponding to the chat to which the message with the callback button was sent.
 *                         Useful for high scores in games.
 * @param data             String Optional. Data associated with the callback button. Be aware that a bad client can send arbitrary data in this field.
 * @param gameShortName    String Optional. Short name of a Game to be returned, serves as the unique identifier for the game
 *
 * '''Note:'''
 *   After the user presses an inline button, Telegram clients will display a progress bar until you call answerCallbackQuery.
 *   It is, therefore, necessary to react by calling answerCallbackQuery even if no notification to the user
 *   is needed (e.g., without specifying any of the optional parameters).
